## Game Rules

Texas Hold'em Poker is a community card game where players aim to make the best possible hand using a combination of their hole cards (private cards) and the shared community cards. The game consists of several rounds:

  -  Preflop: Each player is dealt two private cards facedown.
  -  Flop: Three community cards are dealt face up on the table.
  -  Turn: A fourth community card is dealt face up.
  -  River: A fifth and final community card is dealt face up.
  -  Showdown: Players reveal their hole cards, and the best hand wins the pot.

The game follows standard poker hand rankings, including combinations like pairs, flushes, straights, and more. The winner of the pot is determined based on the strength of their hand.
